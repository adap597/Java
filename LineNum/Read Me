Exercise from Intro to Programming course at Thomas Edison.

Takes an integer command line argument “n” and prints the nth string from the first string found on standard input. 

Please note that you would need to use a queue to implement it for full credit. 
You should add the strings inputted by the user to a queue using the enqueue method. 
Then you should remove and return "n" strings from the queue using the dequeue method. 
The nth string that is returned by the dequeue method should then be printed out.

Sample runs would be as follows.

>java LineNum 2
apple
save
that
is
too
me
<CTRL-D>
2 from the first is save

>java LineNum 3
this
is
not
a
shorter
version
<CTRL-D>
3 from the first is not
