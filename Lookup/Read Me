Exercise from Intro to Programming course at Thomas Edison

Modify the “Lookup” program given in the textbook (program 4.4.1) to make a program “LookupMultipleNumber” 
that prints out multiple values having the same key. 

Notes:
The user would specify the maximum number of values to be printed out for each key as a command line argument after the file name.

Store all such multiple values in a queue. So each element of the symbol table would have a string as a key and a queue object as its value.

Sample runs would be as follows (refer to input file amino.csv).
>java LookupMultipleNumber amino.csv 2 3 0
Tryptophan
TGG
Cysteine
TGT TGC
<CTRL-D>

>java LookupMultipleNumber amino.csv 6 3 0
Cysteine
TGT TGC
Leucine
TTA TTG CTT CTC CTA CTG
<CTRL-D>
