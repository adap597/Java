Exercise from Intro to Programming Course at Thomas Edison

If the search key is in the array, it returns the largest index i for which a[i] is equal to key, but, otherwise, returns â€“i where 
i is the largest index such that a[i] is less than key. It should also be modified to deal with integer arrays rather than string arrays. 

Note: The program should take two command-line arguments, (1) an input file that contains a sorted integer array; and (2) an integer to search for in that array.

Sample runs would be as follows.

>more input.txt
2 3 4 5 6 6 6 7 8 9 11

>java BinarySearch input.txt 10
-9

>java BinarySearch input.txt 6
6
