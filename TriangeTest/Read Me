Exercise from Intro to Programming course at Thomas Edison.
The program tests if three integers entered by the user in the command line could be the sides of a triangle.
If none of the input values is greater than or equal to the sum of the other two, then the program should output “True”; 
otherwise it should output “False.” 

The program should have a static method, “IsTriangular,” that performs the test.
This static method would be called by the main method.
Sample runs would be as follows.

>java TriangularTest 5 3 6
True

>java TriangularTest 5 12 6
False
