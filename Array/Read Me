Exercise from Intro to Programming at Thomas Edison.
Program takes an integer command-line argument and creates an n+1 by n+1 Boolean array. If i and j are relatively prime, it prints true and false otherwise.

A sample run would be as follows.

> java RelativelyPrimeArray 9
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
1    T T T T T T T T
2 T    T F T F T F T
3 T T    T T F T T F
4 T F T    T F T F T
5 T T T T    T T T T
6 T F F F T    T F F
7 T T T T T T    T T
8 T F T F T F T    T
9 T T F T T F T T
