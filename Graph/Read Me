Exercise from Intro to Programming course at Thomas Edison.

Modify the “Graph” program given in the textbook (program 4.5.1) to create a program, “SubGraph”. 
It would take a filename and vertices as input arguments on the command line. 
It would create and print out a graph using the data specified in the file (as is done by the "Graph" program). 
And then it would also print out the subgraph of the graph formed by the vertices that are given on the command line. 
Note: The induced subgraph is the graph comprised of the specified vertices together with all edges from the original graph that connect any two of them.

The input and output of the program should be similar to, or as specified by, the following sample run.
>more graph.txt
A B
A C
C G
A G
H A
B C
B H

>java SubGraph graph.txt A C G
The graph is
A: B C G H
B: A C H
C: A B G
G: A C
H: A B
The subgraph is
A: C G
C: A G
G: A C
