Exercise from Intro to Programming at Thomas Edison.
This program reads lines from standard input, uses printf() to print a table with a column of the names, integers, and the average of the three integers.
The user specifies the number of names as a command-line argument and then types the names along with three integers for each name. 

A sample run would be as follows.

> java Average 4
Joe 3 5 2
Tim 4 1 5
Jane 6 3 2
Jack 8 3 5
<Ctrl-D> 

Joe 3 5 2 3.33
Tim 4 1 5 3.33
Jane 6 3 2 3.67
Jack 8 3 5 5.33
