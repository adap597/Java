Exercise from Intro to Programming at Thomas Edison.
This program takes integer command-line arguments. 
The first argument would be the count of the remaining arguments that are between 1 and 100 (inclusive of 1 and 100). 
It then prints out the count of numbers entered that are less than or equal to 50 and the count of numbers that are greater than 50 from those remaining arguments.

A sample run would be as follows.

> java Distribution100 15 5 82 2 1 74 19 47 64 39 77 25 99 100 1 10
9 numbers entered are less than or equal to 50.
6 numbers entered are greater than 50.
