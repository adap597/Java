Exercise from Intro to Programming at Thomas Edison.
Modify the “LinkedStackOfStrings.java” program given in the textbook (program 4.3.2) 
by adding a method “find()” that takes a string as an argument. 
It should return true if the string argument is in the linked stack and false otherwise. 

The main method should also be modified so that all the strings (other than the search string) 
inputted by the user are stored on the stack before calling the find() method.

Sample runs would be as follows.

>java LinkedStackOfStrings hello
this
is a
test run
for the
hello program
<CTRL-D>
hello exists in the linked stack

>java LinkedStackOfStrings winter
hello world
is the first program
of any programming
language
<CTRL-D>
winter does not exist in the linked stack
