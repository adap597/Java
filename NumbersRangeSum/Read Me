Exercise from Intro to Programming course at Thomas Edison.
Program computes the sum of natural numbers in a given range entered by the user. 

The program has a static recursive method, “getSum” that takes two natural numbers as arguments and computes the sum recursively. 
The sum is returned by the method. This static method would be called by the main method.

Sample runs would be as follows.

>java NumbersRangeSum 6 10
The sum of natural numbers in range [6,10] is 40.

>java NumbersRangeSum 13 20
The sum of natural numbers in range [13, 20] is 132.
